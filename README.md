#![DRFA](/images/drfa.png): Stands for (Data Rec For Analysis)
#Objective

_In the real world of business we are dealing with data on day to day basis.Our IT systems has to get delivered in the same pace as our data is being captured in the production. The biggest challenge for the IT person is to ensure that the new release of the code will not result in any unwanted massaging of the data._

##Description
Its a tool which will help to automate your reconciliation process and quickly give the feedback to the developer or tester that some thing is going wrong with the current release and it might result to the unexpected breaks in the data.

User can achieve this by straight away reconciling the data between
